DETAILED_PROMPT_START
You are a database expert analyzing table relationships for sophisticated analytical SQL queries. This database supports complex multi-table analytics requiring advanced join patterns, statistical analysis, and business intelligence workflows.

CRITICAL ANALYTICAL PATTERNS THIS DATABASE MUST SUPPORT:

**MASSIVE MULTI-TABLE JOIN CHAINS:**
- 7-22 table join sequences
- Star schema analytics with fact tables joining multiple dimension tables
- Complex entity relationship traversals requiring optimal join path planning

**ADVANCED WINDOW FUNCTION ANALYTICS:**
- LAG/LEAD for month-over-month, period-over-period comparisons  
- NTILE for customer segmentation and quartile analysis
- RANK/ROW_NUMBER for top-N analysis within groups
- Cumulative and rolling window calculations

**COMPLEX CASE-BASED BUSINESS LOGIC:**
- Multi-condition CASE statements for customer segmentation and categorization
- Conditional aggregations with CASE for selective counting and summing
- Complex business rule implementation requiring multiple logical branches

**ADVANCED STRING AND DATE PROCESSING:**
- String manipulation (SUBSTR, INSTR) for data parsing and extraction
- Date arithmetic using JULIANDAY for temporal calculations and duration analysis
- GROUP_CONCAT for creating aggregated lists and concatenated results

**MULTI-LEVEL AGGREGATION HIERARCHIES:**
- Annual->Category->Percentage multi-tier calculation workflows
- Nested aggregation patterns requiring multiple GROUP BY levels
- HAVING clauses with complex multi-condition logic for post-aggregation filtering

**PERFORMANCE-CRITICAL MASSIVE JOINS:**
- 6-8 table join sequences requiring optimal execution planning
- Strategic filtering placement for performance optimization in large datasets
- Star schema patterns with careful fact-to-dimension join ordering

**STATISTICAL AND TEMPORAL ANALYSIS:**
- Z-score calculations and statistical anomaly detection
- Time-series analysis with percentage change calculations
- Growth rate analytics and trend identification
- Multi-year comparative analysis with UNION patterns

**COMPLEX BEHAVIORAL FILTERING:**
- EXISTS/NOT EXISTS for behavioral pattern detection
- Subquery filtering for cross-customer behavior analysis
- Purchase funnel and conversion rate analytics
- Cart abandonment and engagement analysis

**BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE WORKFLOWS:**
- RFM customer segmentation (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
- Cross-selling analysis ("customers who bought X also bought Y")
- Performance ranking across categories and time periods
- Revenue optimization and profit margin analysis

TABLE: {table}

TASK: Provide JSON with relationship-focused descriptions and analytical traversal weights (0.0-1.0):

{{
  "table_description": "Business purpose of {table} and its critical role in complex multi-table analytical workflows. Specify the analytical value this table provides in join chains, e.g., 'Central customer hub enabling 6-8 table joins for comprehensive RFM analysis, geographic segmentation, and temporal behavior tracking' or 'Core transaction tracking supporting revenue analysis, customer lifetime value calculations, and multi-level aggregation hierarchies with date arithmetic and conditional logic' or 'Performance tracking entity enabling player statistics aggregation, ranking analysis, and cross-seasonal comparisons with complex CASE-based categorization'.",
  "column_descriptions": {{
    "{table}.column_name": "Column's analytical purpose emphasizing its role in complex queries. Specify: join optimization potential, window function usage, statistical calculations, CASE logic applications, string/date processing. Example: 'Primary join key enabling customer->orders->items->categories analytical chains, supports NTILE segmentation and LAG temporal analysis, critical for multi-level RFM calculations' or 'Temporal dimension supporting date arithmetic (JULIANDAY), growth rate analysis, and conditional aggregations with complex CASE statements' or 'Categorical field enabling GROUP_CONCAT aggregations, HAVING clause filtering, and multi-condition business logic implementation'."
  }},
  "edge_descriptions": {{
    "source->target": "Specific analytical workflow this relationship enables in complex queries. Be explicit about business value: 'Enables customer->orders->payments->items 6-table join chains for RFM segmentation with conditional CASE logic and date arithmetic calculations', 'Supports actor->films->categories->rentals->cities 8-table analytical pathway for geographic performance analysis with string manipulation and temporal calculations', 'Creates player->matches->statistics analytical chains supporting performance ranking, batting averages, and multi-seasonal comparisons with complex aggregation hierarchies', 'Facilitates musical_styles->preferences analytical workflow enabling weighted scoring with multi-condition CASE statements and GROUP_CONCAT list generation'."
  }},
  "edge_weights": {{

  }}
}}

WEIGHT ASSIGNMENT STRATEGY:

**ULTRA-HIGH WEIGHTS (0.9-1.0): Performance-Critical Multi-Table Join Backbones**
- Customer->Orders->Payments->Items: Core e-commerce transactional analysis requiring 4+ table joins
- Actor->Films->Categories->Rentals->Customers->Addresses->Cities: 7-8 table entertainment analytics chains
- Player->Matches->Statistics: Sports analytics requiring complex aggregations and performance calculations
- Any relationship appearing in 6+ table join sequences with heavy analytical processing

**HIGH WEIGHTS (0.8-0.89): Essential Analytical Pathways**
- Geographic dimension joins supporting location-based analytics and string processing
- Time dimension connections enabling date arithmetic, temporal calculations, and growth analysis
- Bridge tables facilitating many-to-many analytics with conditional logic
- Primary business entity relationships supporting RFM, segmentation, and multi-level aggregations

**HIGH WEIGHTS (0.8-0.89): Essential Analytical Pathways**
- Geographic dimension joins (Address->City->Region for location analytics)
- Time dimension connections supporting temporal analysis and window functions
- Bridge tables enabling many-to-many analytics (Users->Purchases->Products)
- Primary business entity relationships supporting RFM and behavioral analysis

**MEDIUM WEIGHTS (0.5-0.7): Supporting Analytics & Enrichment**
- Lookup tables for categorization and business rule application
- Reference tables supporting EXISTS/NOT EXISTS filtering patterns
- Secondary dimensions for multi-dimensional analysis
- Status/classification tables for conditional aggregations

**LOW WEIGHTS (0.1-0.4): Metadata & Administrative**
- Audit trail relationships rarely used in business analytics
- System configuration and administrative reference data
- Optional metadata not participating in core analytical workflows

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: You MUST provide weights for ALL {edge_count} relationships listed above:
{all_edges}

ANALYTICAL FOCUS PRIORITIES:

1. **Performance-Optimized Join Sequences**: Prioritize relationships in the most common 6-8 table analytical workflows requiring strategic execution planning
2. **Advanced Function Enablement**: Emphasize relationships supporting window functions, date arithmetic, string manipulation, and conditional logic
3. **Multi-Level Aggregation Support**: Highlight relationships enabling hierarchical calculations, GROUP_CONCAT operations, and complex HAVING clause filtering
4. **Business Logic Implementation**: Focus on relationships supporting complex CASE statements, conditional aggregations, and weighted scoring algorithms
5. **Cross-Entity Analytics**: Prioritize paths enabling customer lifetime value, performance ranking, geographic analysis, and behavioral segmentation
6. **Scalability & Performance**: Emphasize relationships critical for large dataset processing with optimal join ordering and filtering strategies

The weights will be MULTIPLIED with original graph weights to optimize complex analytical query path planning and execution.
