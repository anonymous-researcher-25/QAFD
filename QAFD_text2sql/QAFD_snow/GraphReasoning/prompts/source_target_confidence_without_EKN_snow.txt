## Task Definition
You are a Text-to-SQL planner agent. 
Given:
- A user query: {QUERY}
- A database schema summary in text format: {SCHEMA_SUMMARY}
- External knowledge document in text format: {KNOWLEDGE_DOCUMENT}

Your job is to:
1. Review this schema summary, external knowledge document and user query thoroughly. 
2. Break the user query into at least 2-3 logical user subqueries. 
3. **For each subquery, systematically examine EVERY single node (TABLE.column) in the database schema graph one by one:**
   - Go through each table in the schema summary sequentially
   - For each table, examine every column within that table
   - For each TABLE.column node, evaluate its relationship strength with the current subquery
   - Document your analysis for each node, determining if it has any of these RELATIONSHIP TYPES with the subquery:
     - SEMANTIC: Direct or indirect relevance to query concepts
     - STRUCTURAL: Representing organizational structures in the query
     - TEMPORAL: Time-based connections to query elements
     - CAUSAL: Cause-effect relationships described in the query
     - LOGICAL: Supporting logical conditions in the query
     - STATISTICAL: Statistical correlations to query concepts
     - DOMAIN-SPECIFIC: Domain relevancy with query
   - **Source nodes**: ALL STARTING COLUMNS (with table prefixes) having strong relationships of ANY TYPE ABOVE with the subquery.
   - **Target nodes**: ALL DESTINATION COLUMNS (with table prefixes) having strong relationships of ANY TYPE ABOVE with the subquery.
   - **MANDATORY**: You must examine and consider every single TABLE.column combination in the schema before proceeding to the next step.

4. When domain-specific concepts appear in the query, properly map these concepts to the appropriate schema column elements
5. **Identify the most confident path of schema graph**: For each subquery, determine and explicitly state the most confident path that the LLM should follow through the schema graph, using right arrow format (->) with ONLY schema nodes.
6. **Provide reasoning confidence candidates**: For each subquery, provide  2-3 DIVERS CANDIDATES in format [source, target, confidence] where source is a starting node, target is an ending node, and confidence is a float between 0.0-1.0. Each candidate should represent a different interpretation or approach to solving the subquery.

Important:
- Schema nodes MUST be specified as "TABLE.column" EXACTLY the same as they appear in the schema summary. EVEN DO NOT change upper or lower letters.
- The most confident path should use the right arrow format (->) and contain ONLY schema nodes (TABLE.column format)
- Reasoning confidence candidates should be in format: [source, target, confidence] with 2-3 DIVERS CANDIDATES per subquery
- Each candidate should explore different semantic interpretations, alternative join paths, or different relationship types
- **CRITICAL**: You MUST systematically go through every single table and every single column in the schema graph during step 3 analysis
- Only output a json without explanation 

Example
User Query:
"Find the most popular movie category among customers living in cities that start with 'A' or have a hyphen in their name"

Response:
```json

  {
    "subquery": "Filter cities that start with 'A' or have a hyphen",
    "query_seeds": ["cities", "start with 'A'", "hyphen in name"],
    "most_confident_path": "CITY.city_name",
    "reasoning_confidence": [
      ["CITY.city_name", "CITY.city_name", 1.0],
      ["CITY.city_id", "CITY.city_name", 0.85],
    ]
  },
  {
    "subquery": "Connect cities to customers",

    "source_target_confidence": [
      ["CITY.city_id", "CUSTOMER.address_id", 0.92],
      ["CITY.city_id", "CUSTOMER.customer_id", 0.88],
    ]
  },
  {
    "subquery": "Find movie rentals by these customers",
    "query_seeds": ["customers", "rentals"],

    "source_target_confidence": [
      ["CUSTOMER.customer_id", "RENTAL.inventory_id", 0.85],
      ["CUSTOMER.customer_id", "RENTAL.rental_id", 0.80],
    ]
  },
  {
    "subquery": "Determine the most popular movie category",
    "query_seeds": ["most popular", "movie category"],
    "most_confident_path": "RENTAL.inventory_id -> INVENTORY.inventory_id -> INVENTORY.film_id -> FILM_CATEGORY.film_id -> FILM_CATEGORY.category_id -> CATEGORY.category_id -> CATEGORY.name",
    "source_target_confidence": [
      ["RENTAL.inventory_id", "CATEGORY.name", 0.88],
      ["INVENTORY.film_id", "CATEGORY.name", 0.90],
    ]
  }
