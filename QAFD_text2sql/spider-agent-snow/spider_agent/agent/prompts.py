First, run `ls` to see which files are in the current folder.
1. To begin with, you MUST check query.py, README.md, result.csv (if present) first. If there are any other markdown files in the /workspace directory, you MUST read them, as they may contain useful information for answering your questions.
2. Use BQ_GET_TABLES to list all tables and BQ_GET_TABLE_INFO or BQ_SAMPLE_ROWS for specific details. After gathering schema info, use BIGQUERY_EXEC_SQL to run your SQL queries and interact with the database.
3. Use BIGQUERY_EXEC_SQL to run your SQL queries and interact with the database. Do not use this action to query INFORMATION_SCHEMA; When you have doubts about the schema, you can repeatedly use BQ_GET_TABLES, BQ_GET_TABLE_INFO and BQ_SAMPLE_ROWS.
4. Be prepared to write multiple SQL queries to find the correct answer. Once it makes sense, consider it resolved.
5. Focus on SQL queries rather than frequently using Bash commands like grep and cat, though they can be used when necessary.
6. If you encounter an SQL error, reconsider the database information and your previous queries, then adjust your SQL accordingly. Don't output same SQL queries repeatedly!!!!
7. Make sure you get valid results, not an empty file. Once the results are stored in `result.csv`, ensure the file contains data. If it is empty or just table header, it means your SQL query is incorrect!
8. The final result should be a final answer, not an .sql file, a calculation, an idea, or merely an intermediate step. If the answer is a table, save it as a CSV and provide the file name. If not, directly provide the answer in text form, not just the SQL statement.

# Snowflake-Query #
1. BEFORE following any other rules, you MUST follow these steps:
   - Read the schema.json in the /workspace directory. The schema.json contains valuable information about the graph structure and path rewards.
   - Identify the highest-reward subquery path for EACH division in the provided schema.json
   - Write your VERY FIRST SQL query by combining ONLY these highest-reward paths to address the main query
   - DO NOT perform ANY database inspection before executing this first query
   - You MUST run this query as your FIRST SQL execution
   - You MUST terminate execution immediately after this first query if it works

   For your FIRST SQL attempt, follow ONLY these steps:
   - Review the schema.json structure containing all subqueries and their reward values
   - For each division (subquery), identify the path with the highest reward
   - Combine these highest-reward paths into a SINGLE comprehensive SQL query
   - Execute this SQL query immediately with no other database commands before it

   Do NOT run any exploratory queries like:
   - DO NOT run "SELECT * FROM table LIMIT 5"
   - DO NOT run "PRAGMA table_info(table_name)" 
   - DO NOT run "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'"
   - DO NOT check data types
   - DO NOT check for NULL values
   - DO NOT try to understand the schema first
   - DO NOT check DDL.csv files before attempting the first query

   Your first query must be the direct SQL translation of combining all highest-reward paths to address the main query objective.

2. If your first query fails, then you should explore the database structure further using the methods below. You can check DDL.csv file with the database's DDL, along with JSON files that contain the column names, column types, column descriptions, and sample rows for individual tables. You can review the DDL.csv file in each directory, then selectively examine the JSON files as needed. Read them carefully.

3. You can use SNOWFLAKE_EXEC_SQL to run your SQL queries and interact with the database. Do not use this action to query INFORMATION_SCHEMA or SHOW DATABASES/TABLES; the schema information is all stored in the /workspace/database_name folder. Refer to this folder whenever you have doubts about the schema.

4. Be prepared to write multiple SQL queries to find the correct answer. Once it makes sense, consider it resolved.

5. Focus on SQL queries rather than frequently using Bash commands like grep and cat, though they can be used when necessary.

6. If you encounter an SQL error, reconsider the database information and your previous queries, then adjust your SQL accordingly. Do not output the same SQL queries repeatedly.

7. Ensure you get valid results, not an empty file. Once the results are stored in result.csv, make sure the file contains data. If it is empty or just contains the table header, it means your SQL query is incorrect.

8. The final result MUST be a CSV file, not an .sql file, a calculation, an idea, a sentence or merely an intermediate step. Save the answer as a CSV and provide the file name, it is usually from the SQL execution result.

# Tips #
1. When referencing table names in Snowflake SQL, you must include both the database_name and schema_name. For example, for /workspace/DEPS_DEV_V1/DEPS_DEV_V1/ADVISORIES.json, if you want to use it in SQL, you should write DEPS_DEV_V1.DEPS_DEV_V1.ADVISORIES.
2. Do not write SQL queries to retrieve the schema; use the existing schema documents in the folders.
3. When encountering bugs, carefully analyze and think them through; avoid writing repetitive code.
4. Column names must be enclosed in quotes. But don't use \",just use ".

First, run `ls` to identify the database, if there is a 'result.csv' in the initial folder, check it, the format of your answer must match it.
Then explore the SQLite/DuckDB database on your own.
I recommend using `LOCAL_DB_SQL` to explore the database and obtain the final answer.
Make sure to fully explore the table's schema before writing the SQL query, otherwise your query may contain many non-existent tables or columns.
Be ready to write multiple SQL queries to find the correct answer. Once it makes sense, consider it resolved and terminate. 
The final result should be a final answer, not an .sql file, a calculation, an idea, or merely an intermediate step. If it's a table, save it as a CSV and provide the file name. Otherwise, terminate with the answer in text form, not the SQL statement.

3. **Solve the task** by reviewing the YAML files, understanding the task requirements, understanding the database and identifying the SQL transformations needed to complete the project. 
4. The project is an unfinished project. You need to understand the task and refer to the YAML file to identify which defined model SQLs are incomplete. You must complete these SQLs in order to finish the project.
5. When encountering bugs, you must not attempt to modify the yml file; instead, you should write correct SQL based on the existing yml.
6. After writing all required SQL, run `dbt run` to update the database.
7. You may need to write multiple SQL queries to get the correct answer; do not easily assume the task is complete. You must complete all SQL queries according to the YAML files.
8. You'd better to verify the new data models generated in the database to ensure they meet the definitions in the YAML files.
9. In most cases, you do not need to modify existing SQL files; you only need to create new SQL files according to the YAML files. You should only make modifications if the SQL file clearly appears to be unfinished at the end.
10. Once the data transformation is complete and the task is solved, terminate the DuckDB file name, DON't TERMINATE with CSV FILE.
